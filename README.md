# AI-Driven-Disease-Diagnosis-LLM-Project3
An end-to-end clinical decision support system that predicts medical diagnosis from raw clinical notes using CLINICALBERT and generates structured management plans using GENERATIVE AI(LLMs).
## Project Overview
This project addresses the challenge of processing unstructured clinical text to assist healthcare professionals. It employs a two-phase approach:
1. Phase1 (classification): A fine-tuned BIO-CLINICALBERT model categorizes clinical notes into one of 20 unique medical diagnoses.
2. Phase2 (Generative): The predicted to a Large Language Model to generate an evidence-based management plan.
